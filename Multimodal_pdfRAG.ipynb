ZSP involves dynamically provisioning privileged access to users or systems on an as-needed basis, granting temporary and scoped privileges only when required for speciﬁc tasks or workﬂows. By implementing ZSP, organizations can reduce the number of privileged accounts with permanent access rights. This approach helps to minimize the attack surface and prevent unauthorized users from exploiting prolonged access to critical resources.\n",

Organizations can achieve this by applying CIS Benchmark (https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/microsoft_windows_server) or Microsoft Security Baseline (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55319) group policies or conﬁgurations to the SIA connector servers.

If your recurring access policies allow access to dev systems, you may want to be more lenient with the access; for production systems, think about how the access timeframe can be more restrictive. Length of sessions and permitted idle time: The length of sessions should be a balance between how much time is required by the members to perform their work on average. Being too restrictive with the length of the session can cause the sessions to close sooner than the work can be completed. It’s important to allow enough time for the work to be completed. Deﬁne policies for lower-risk targets where the length of the sessions and the idle time are longer. For more critical targets, carefully deﬁne the length of the sessions and the idle time just enough to allow users to perform their work and end the sessions if they are idle for an unacceptable length of time. For these more critical systems, no more than 2 hours of idle time should be considered.\n",

CyberArk recommends deﬁning a user with only the right privileges on the system for the connection, disabling password and ssh key login for that user, and allowing only ssh certiﬁcate-based auth. For each authorized connection, SIA generates and signs an SSH certiﬁcate with the CA private key which is used to authenticate the end user to the target machine as the existing local user of the target machine. This SSH certiﬁcate is invalidated for further use within minutes, so that no one else can use it. Every new authorized connection request, even by the same user to the same target, generates a new SSH certiﬁcate.
