Access rules also deﬁne session settings like how long the sessions can be and how much idle time is permitted before the session is automatically closed. Members: When deﬁning the members in an policy, opt for using roles rather than individual users when possible. Using roles instead of users allows admins to more easily control and deﬁne which users have access to targets in the environment.

If your recurring access policies allow access to dev systems, you may want to be more lenient with the access; for production systems, think about how the access timeframe can be more restrictive. Length of sessions and permitted idle time: The length of sessions should be a balance between how much time is required by the members to perform their work on average. Being too restrictive with the length of the session can cause the sessions to close sooner than the work can be completed. It’s important to allow enough time for the work to be completed. Deﬁne policies for lower-risk targets where the length of the sessions and the idle time are longer. For more critical targets, carefully deﬁne the length of the sessions and the idle time just enough to allow users to perform their work and end the sessions if they are idle for an unacceptable length of time. For these more critical systems, no more than 2 hours of idle time should be considered.',\n",

For each authorized connection, SIA generates and signs an SSH certiﬁcate with the CA private key which is used to authenticate the end user to the target machine as the existing local user of the target machine. This SSH certiﬁcate is invalidated for further use within minutes, so that no one else can use it.
